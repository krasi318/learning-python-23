This piece of code is a project of mine, this is one of my first projects and the first one in Python.
It ain't big - for sure, but it implements the few things I've been studying.

When you start the program you can choose from four options : ADD/DELETE/UPDATE/END

ADD: adds a task to the to-do list. The program will prompt you to enter the task's content.
It gets the time and date and num automatically.

DELETE: deletes a task from the to-do list. The program prompts you the num of the task and it matches
the task from the list and it deletes it.

UPDATE: updates the task's content to the list. The program prompts you 2 things - desired task's num and the
updated content of the task.

END: this is not a function, this changes the value of the "ending" boolean to False, which makes the while loop stop.
